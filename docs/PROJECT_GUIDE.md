# PROJECT GUIDE — Read This First (for any LLM / new contributor)

This single file explains the **entire** Siddharth Dongardive portfolio site well
enough that you can understand it and safely edit it **without reading every
source file first**. Read this top-to-bottom once, then jump to the section for
whatever you're changing.

> Companion docs (more detail on specific tasks):
> - [`ADDING_PROJECTS.md`](ADDING_PROJECTS.md) — add a book (project) or a shelf (category).
> - [`CHAPTER_PAGE.md`](CHAPTER_PAGE.md) — the per-project detail page & its image galleries.

## 1. What this is

A single-page, scroll-driven **portfolio site** themed as a **library**. A
visitor scrolls through a sequence of full-screen sections joined by cinematic
scroll transitions, and clicking a "book" opens a project case-study page.

- **Frontend:** React 18 + Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion + GSAP (ScrollTrigger)
  for animation, Lenis for smooth scroll, React Router for the 2 routes.
- **Backend:** FastAPI (Python). Serves project data and accepts the contact form.
  It is **data-only** — all visuals live in the frontend.
- **Source of truth for content:** the backend (`backend/data.py`). The frontend
  fetches it; a bundled fallback keeps the UI working if the API is down.

## 2. Run it

```bash
# backend (terminal 1) — from repo root
cd backend
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8000        # NOTE: main:app, NOT app.main:app

# frontend (terminal 2)
cd frontend
npm install
npm run dev                                   # http://localhost:5173
```

Vite proxies `/api/*` → `http://localhost:8000` in dev (see `frontend/vite.config.js`),
so no CORS setup is needed locally. To point at a deployed API, set `VITE_API_BASE`.
`npm run build` produces the production bundle; there are no unit tests — verify
changes by running the app and scrolling through.

## 4. Design tokens (Tailwind) — use these, don't hardcode hex

Defined in `frontend/tailwind.config.js`:

| Token | Value | Meaning |
|-------|-------|---------|
| `cream` | `#F7F1ED` | primary background |
| `ink` | `#171717` | primary text / dark sections |
| `terracotta` | `#D9834A` | accent (signature, small marks) |
| `mustard` | `#FFE862` | footer / yellow sections |
| `bark` / `barklight` / `wood` / `tan` | browns | Toolbox section only |
| font `sans` | General Sans / Inter | body & UI (default) |
| font `display` | Playfair Display / Georgia | big display headings (`font-display`) |
| tracking `headline` | `-0.03em` | tight tracking for large headings (`tracking-headline`) |

Global helpers in `src/index.css`: `.dot-grid` (the dotted background texture),
`.tw-cursor` (blinking typewriter caret), `.book-title` (vertical text for book
spines), `.scrollbar-none`. Site-wide horizontal padding convention is
`px-8 md:px-16` — this aligns content to the fixed vertical frame lines (see §7).

## 5. The page as a scroll sequence (READ THIS before touching Home.jsx)

`pages/Home.jsx` is the composition root. The visitor scrolls through this order:

```
Hero (cream)                 ← intro, signature draws, name, Menu pill
  │  transition #1: hero is sticky; Statement's stepped podium rises over it,
  │                 hero sinks + fades (framer-motion useScroll on statementRef)
Statement (black)            ← "Every book on this shelf…" pinned word-by-word reveal
  │  transition #2+#3: PinnedCurtainChain
ProjectShelf (cream)         ← the bookshelf; click a book → modal → project page
  │  (curtain)
Toolbox (dark brown)         ← tools hanging on nails, swing on hover
  │  (curtain, mode:'scale', dwell)
ReadingCorner (black)        ← articles as little books
  │  final transition: #contact reveal window; footer rises + fades in
Footer (mustard, FIXED)      ← ghost name, LIBRARY CLOSED, links, live IST clock
```

Key structural facts (do not break these):

- **`<Footer>` is `position: fixed` at `z-0`, behind everything.** `<main>` is
  `z-10` and opaque, so it covers the footer. The last thing in the DOM before
  the footer is a `<div id="contact" class="h-screen">` **reveal window** — as
  it scrolls up, the fixed footer is uncovered. That same `#contact` element is
  the scroll driver for the footer's rise-in animation (`footerRise` →
  `riseStyle` prop). If you add a section after ReadingCorner, it goes **inside
  `<main>`**, before `#contact`.
- **Transition #1** (Hero→Statement) is Framer Motion: `useScroll` on
  `statementRef` drives `heroSink` (`y`/`opacity`/`scale`) passed to `<Hero sinkStyle>`.
- **Transitions #2 & #3** (Shelf→Toolbox→ReadingCorner) are GSAP via
  `<PinnedCurtainChain>` — see §8.
- The **Statement** section does its own internal pin (a tall `h-[300vh]` track
  with a `sticky` inner) — it's self-contained, not part of the chain.

## 6. Component map (what each file is)

**Sections (rendered by Home.jsx, in scroll order):**
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `Hero.jsx` | Landing: animated signature, typed greeting, big name, Menu pill. |
| `Statement.jsx` | Black interlude; scroll-pinned word-by-word text reveal + drawn line. |
| `ProjectShelf.jsx` | The bookshelf. Fetched projects → `BookSpine`s grouped by shelf. Owns `BookModal`. |
| `Toolbox.jsx` | "Tools Behind Every Chapter" — tech icons hanging on nails. |
| `ReadingCorner.jsx` | "Reading Corner" — articles rendered as little 3D books. |
| `Footer.jsx` | Fixed mustard footer: ghost name, CTA, social links, live clock. |

**Transition / motion infrastructure:**
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `PinnedCurtainChain.jsx` | Chains N sections via N-1 GSAP pin+scrub "curtain" reveals. The core scroll engine. See §8. |
| `PinnedCurtain.jsx` | Single-pair version (currently Home uses the Chain; keep for reference/reuse). |
| `SmoothScroll.jsx` | Lenis smooth-scroll, synced to GSAP ticker + ScrollTrigger. Mounted once in App. |
| `PageTransition.jsx` | `PageTransitionProvider` + `usePageTransition()` — the book-cover wipe between routes. |
| `ScrollMorphEdge.jsx` | A wavy SVG edge whose curve reacts to scroll velocity (section seams). |

**Reusable pieces / effects:**
| File | Role |
|------|------|
| `BookSpine.jsx` | One book on the shelf (colored spine, vertical title). |
| `BookModal.jsx` | Opens on book click; "View Full Project" → `usePageTransition` to `/projects/:slug`. |
| `ImageGallery.jsx` | Chapter-page gallery: 1 img=full, 2=side-by-side, 3+=horizontal scroll. |
| `ContactModal.jsx` | The contact form; POSTs via `sendContact`. |
| `MenuPill.jsx` | The hero's expandable nav pill. |
| `Signature.jsx` | SVG signature with a draw-on animation (`play` prop). |
| `MaskedRevealText.jsx` | Lines that slide up from a clip mask (`inView` prop). |
| `Typewriter.jsx` / `CyclingTypewriter.jsx` | Typed text (one-shot / looping). |
| `CursorBadge.jsx` | Custom cursor label (e.g. "Click" over books). |
| `EyeFollowButton.jsx` | Button whose "eyes" track the cursor. |
| `FrameLines.jsx` | The two fixed vertical border lines framing the whole site. |

**Pages:** `Home.jsx` (§5), `ProjectDetail.jsx` (see `CHAPTER_PAGE.md`).

## 7. The vertical frame lines (why content must respect `px-8 md:px-16`)

`FrameLines.jsx` renders two `position: fixed` hairlines at `left-4/right-4`
(mobile) and `left-10/right-10` (desktop), at `z-[60]`, on **every** route (it's
in `App.jsx` outside the router). Section content uses `px-8 md:px-16` so it sits
*inside* those lines. **Do not** wrap a page's content in a narrow centered
`max-w-*` container at the top level — that visually detaches content from the
frame. Constrain inner text with `max-w-*` if needed, but let structural
padding be `px-8 md:px-16`.

## 8. PinnedCurtainChain — the scroll transition engine (edit carefully)

`components/PinnedCurtainChain.jsx` takes `sections={[{ node, ... }]}` and mounts
each **exactly once**, wiring N-1 GSAP ScrollTrigger transitions between
consecutive pairs. For pair (i, i+1): section *i* pins when its bottom hits the
viewport bottom; section *i+1* slides up (`yPercent: 100 → 0`) over ~1 viewport
of scrubbed scroll, like a curtain rising over the pinned section.

Per-section options (on the object, applies to the transition that reveals it):
- `dwellVh` (number): extra pinned scroll AFTER the reveal completes, holding the
  section fully covering the screen (so a fast scroller actually sees it).
- `startOffsetVh` (number): pinned hold BEFORE the curtain starts rising.
- `mode: 'scale'`: scale-through — the outgoing section recedes (scale down +
  dim) while the incoming settles forward from slightly oversized. The stage is
  painted black during this so no transparent gap shows the fixed footer.

Hard-won invariants (breaking these caused real bugs — don't regress them):
- Each section is measured (ResizeObserver) and rendered **once**; never render a
  section twice "for spacing."
- Each stage's height is independent — never chain a shared `margin-top:-100vh`,
  it compounds and collapses later sections.
- Below `md` the pins are skipped entirely (touch pinning is janky) — sections
  just stack with a light fade-in.
- Animate inner content nodes for `scale` mode, never the pinned stage element
  (ScrollTrigger owns its transform). Avoid animating `filter: blur()` on
  image-heavy sections — it re-rasterizes every frame (caused the Toolbox lag).

Lenis + GSAP are already synced in `SmoothScroll.jsx` (Lenis drives the GSAP
ticker; ScrollTrigger updates on Lenis scroll). Any new ScrollTrigger you add
inherits this automatically — don't create a second Lenis instance.

## 9. Backend API

`backend/main.py` — FastAPI, CORS open to the Vite dev origins. Endpoints:

| Method + path | Returns |
|---|---|
| `GET /api/projects` | `{ categories, shelves, projects, grouped }` |
| `GET /api/projects/{slug}` | one full project object, or 404 |
| `POST /api/contact` | validates `{name, email, message}`, appends to `contact_messages.jsonl`, returns `{ok, message}` |
| `GET /api/health` | `{status: "ok"}` |

All project content is built in `backend/data.py` (see `ADDING_PROJECTS.md` for
the exact shape and how to add entries). `frontend/src/data/fallbackProjects.js`
mirrors it for offline use — keep them roughly in sync.

## 10. How to make common changes (playbook)

- **Add / edit a project or category** → `backend/data.py` (+ mirror in
  `fallbackProjects.js`). Full steps in `ADDING_PROJECTS.md`. You rarely touch
  React for this — the shelf and chapter page are data-driven.
- **Edit the project detail page layout / galleries** → `ProjectDetail.jsx` +
  `ImageGallery.jsx`; see `CHAPTER_PAGE.md`.
- **Change a section's look** → edit that section's component in §6. It won't
  affect the transitions (those live in `PinnedCurtainChain` / Home).
- **Change / add a scroll transition** → `Home.jsx` (composition) and/or
  `PinnedCurtainChain.jsx` (engine). Re-read §5 and §8 first; test at both slow
  and fast scroll speeds and on a narrow (mobile) width.
- **Add a new full-screen section before the footer** → add its component, then
  insert it inside `<main>` in `Home.jsx` — either in the `PinnedCurtainChain`
  `sections` array (to get a curtain transition) or as a plain block. It must be
  **before** the `#contact` reveal window, never after it.
- **Change colors / fonts** → `tailwind.config.js` tokens (§4), then use the
  token classes; don't scatter raw hex codes.
- **Footer content / links / CTA** → `Footer.jsx`. The footer is fixed and
  reveal-animated; keep it `position: fixed` and keep the `riseStyle` wrapper.

## 11. Gotchas / non-obvious things

- The **signature draw animation** should play once, when its section enters view
  (`Signature` takes a `play` prop). Don't trigger it globally on load.
- The footer being `fixed` behind `<main>` is intentional (§5). If the footer
  ever "disappears" or shows through a gap mid-page, it's a `z-index` /
  transparent-stage issue in a transition, not the footer itself.
- `uvicorn` target is `main:app` (the file is `backend/main.py`), **not**
  `app.main:app` — there is no `app/` package.
- No test suite. "Verify" = run the app, scroll the whole page slowly and fast,
  open a book → its project page, submit the contact form.
- `.dot-grid` + the `px-8 md:px-16` padding + `FrameLines` together create the
  framed look; changing one without the others looks broken.
